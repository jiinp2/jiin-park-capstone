# Focal 

## Overview 

Focal transforms travel memories into interactive, mapped experiences, allowing users to visualize and share their journeys with ease. 

### Problem 

Travel memories are often fragmented—photos stored in the cloud, notes scattered across apps, and journals left unfinished. This makes it difficult to revisit past experiences or document trips in a structured way.

Journaling is a thoughtful way to capture travel moments, but it’s difficult to maintain. Many travellers return home with blank pages or postpone documenting their trips, only to feel overwhelmed later. Photos, however, are effortless and naturally capture valuable metadata—timestamps, locations, and context—that can reconstruct a trip’s timeline.

By leveraging this existing habit, travel documentation becomes more seamless. Users can stay present during their trips while relying on their photos to help them organize and relive their journeys later.
